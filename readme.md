## beginning of the project

homepage and the basic scss has been started. currently trying to figure out why my footer is not spanning the whole width of the screen as well as try to make nav button align and space equally along the right had side of the page.

i will need to edit the image so i dont have to scroll down to see the footer. 

![first draft](./docs/screenshot1.png)

basically the first iterations of the index.html and index.scss.
